# Introduction:
I built ShopKart, a Flipkart clone, to showcase my frontend development skills. Using React and other modern web technologies, I developed a comprehensive e-commerce application that includes core features such as a product landing page, product category page, product detail page, cart, and payment gateway integration through Stripe.

# Purpose and Goal:

The primary purpose of creating ShopKart was to demonstrate my ability to design and develop a full-fledged e-commerce application. The goals were to:

Showcase proficiency in React and related technologies.
Implement essential e-commerce functionalities.
Create a user-friendly and responsive web application.
Prepare for front-end developer job interviews by building a practical project.


# Web Stack and Explanation:

React: Used for building the user interface and managing the component state.
React Router: Implemented for seamless navigation between different pages.
Context API: Employed for efficient state management across the application.
CSS Modules: Used for styling components in a modular and maintainable way.
APIs: Integrated to fetch and display real-time product data and information.
React Icons: Used to include icons throughout the application for better visual representation.
Stripe: Integrated for handling secure payment transactions.
Problems and Thought Process:

 # State Management: Managing the state of an e-commerce application can be complex, especially when dealing with products, cart items, and user authentication. I chose Context API for its simplicity and efficiency in managing global state without the need for external libraries.
 
# API Integration: Fetching real-time product data required seamless integration with APIs. I ensured proper error handling and loading states to enhance the user experience.

# Payment Gateway Integration: Integrating Stripe for payment processing was a significant challenge. I followed Stripe's documentation to implement a secure and reliable payment system.

# This project highlights my ability to build and manage a complex web application, demonstrating my skills in React, state management, API integration, responsive design, and secure payment processing.
